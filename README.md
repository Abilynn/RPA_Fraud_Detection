# RPA_Fraud_Detection
### Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. To address this issue, an analysis was conducted with a focus on several key assumptions:

The finance department noted that some of the fraudulent transactions were recorded as coming from Smokey Bear’s zip code (20252).
Finance has also noticed a number of pseudonyms associated with fraudulent transactions. The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name.
There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from. For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use.
Users are making fraudulent transactions using a temporary email address service. These services provide a short-lived email that can be verified and then self-destructs.(temp_email.com)
The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’.
